Impact of multivalency in the formation of cellular membrane-less organelles.
All living cells contain a number of organelles; structures within the cell specialized to perform a number of tasks.
Some of these organelles are enclosed by a lipid membrane as a way of concentrating certain enzymes and reactants in a confined space, as well as to separate organelles from the cytocol and its contents. Other organelles are not membrane-bound. These organelles can be formed from liquid-liquid phase separation, creating small areas within the cytoplasm with a higher concentration of proteins than the surrounding area. Important for this process are the electrostatic interactions between polymers, which will be discussed later. The forming of such membrane-less organelles are the ones that will be analyzed further in this project. 

Our project objective is to model this biological system in such a way that ultimately, we can describe a multipolymeric system numerically and form such a system which iteratively "seeks" the lowest total energy possible for the system (given some parametres).To do this, we have first discretizied the cytocol to a square two-dimensional grid. In attempt to simplify the content of our grid, we are only numerically representing the contents of the cytocol that are critical to the formation of membrane-less organelles, leaving out other "spectator molecules".
